# Software_QA_Test

### This repo include some test cases, bug reports, and my personal review regarding to [phptravels.net](https://www.phptravels.net/).

- Built on Windows 10 OS, using [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
- Package built using PyCharm IDE using Virtual Environment.

## 
Please download the newest driver and match your operating system [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and replace the old [driver/geckodriver.exe](https://github.com/faiznc/Software_QA_Test/tree/master/driver).

You can use your own Python environment to run the script by installing [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) package.

`pip install selenium`

Or you can just use the included [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#activating-a-virtual-environment) module on venv [folder](https://github.com/faiznc/Software_QA_Test/tree/master/venv]).

More informations about Python's Virtual Environment (venv) usage can be seen [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#activating-a-virtual-environment).
